Before launching rails, you will need to create and seed your database the first time.  
This requires commenting lines 4,5,6 of config/initilaizers/std_vars.rb or else the migration will fail
After commenting out above, type 'rake db:migrate' and then 'rake db:seed' to set up DB
You will likely also want to load the zip code/lat/lon table of the database with rake:load_zip_lat_lons
